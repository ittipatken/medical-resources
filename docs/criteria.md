#### [Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) grading of angina pectoris](https://ccs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ang_Gui_1976.pdf)

### [Revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis](https://gut.bmj.com/content/62/1/102)

Definition of diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features:

1. Abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back)
2. Serum lipase activity (or amylase activity) at least 3 times greater than the upper limit of normal
3. Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and less commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transabdominal ultrasonography

> - If _abdominal pain suggests strongly_ that acute pancreatitis is present, but the _serum amylase and/or lipase activity is less than 3 times the upper limit of normal_, as may be the case with delayed presentation, _imaging will be required_ to confirm the diagnosis.
> - If the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is established by _abdominal pain and by increases in the serum pancreatic enzyme activities_, a _CECT is not usually required_ for diagnosis in the emergency room or on admission to the hospital.

| 1     | _Pre-adolescent_. Testes, scrotum, and penis are of about the same size and proportion as in early childhood.                                                                                                       |
| 2     | The _scrotum and testes have enlarged_ and there is a change in the texture of the scrotal skin. There is also some reddening of the scrotal skin but this cannot be detected on black and white photographs.       |
| 3     | _Growth of the penis_ has occurred, at first _mainly in length_ but with some increase in breadth. There has been further growth of testes and scrotum.                                                             |
| 4     | Penis further _enlarged in length and breadth with development of glans_. Testes and scrotum further enlarged. There is also further darkening of the scrotal skin, but this is difficult to detect on photographs. |
| 5     | Genitalia _adult in size and shape_. No further enlargement takes place after Stage 5 is reached.                                                                                                                   |

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | _Pre-adolescent_; elevation of papilla only.                                                                     |
| 2     | _Breast and bud stage; elevation of breast and papilla_ as a small mound, enlargement of areola diameter.        |
| 3     | _Further enlargement of breast and areola_, with no separation of their contours.                                |
| 4     | Projection of areola and papilla to form a _secondary mound_ above the level of the breast.                      |
| 5     | Mature stage; _projection of papilla_ only, due to recession of the areola to the general contour of the breast. |

3. Boys and Girls - Pubic Hair Stages

| Stage | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | _Pre-adolescent_. The vellus over the pubes is no further developed than that over the abdominal wall, i.e. no pubic hair.                                                                                                      |
| 2     | Sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, _downy hair_, straight or only slightly curled, appearing chiefly _at the base of the penis_. This stage is difficult to see on photographs, particularly of fair-haired subjects.   |
| 3     | Considerably _darker, coarser, and more curled_. The hair spreads sparsely over the junction of the pubes. This and subsequent stages were clearly recognizable on the photographs.                                             |
| 4     | Hair is now _adult in type_, but the area covered by it is still considerably smaller than in most adults. There is no spread to the medial surface of the thighs.                                                              |
| 5     | Adult in quantity and type, distributed as an inverse triangle of the classically feminine pattern. _Spread to the medial surface of the thighs_ but not up the linea alba or elsewhere above the base of the inverse triangle. |
