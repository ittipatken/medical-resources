| I     | Ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walkingm and climbing stairs. Angina with _strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion_ at work or recreation.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, or in wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening. Walking more than two blocks on the level and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions. |
| III   | _Marked limitation_ of ordinary physical activity. Walking one or two blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at normal pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
