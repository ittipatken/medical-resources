| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I     | Ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walkingm and climbing stairs. Angina with _strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion_ at work or recreation.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| II    | _Slight limitation_ of ordinary activity. Walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, or in wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening. Walking more than two blocks on the level and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions. |
| III   | _Marked limitation_ of ordinary physical activity. Walking one or two blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at normal pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| IV    | Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, anginal syndrome may be _present at rest_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Class | Patient Symptoms                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I     | _No limitation_ of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation or shortness of breath.                            |
| II    | _Slight limitation_ of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, shortness of breath or chest pain. |
| III   | _Marked limitation_ of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, shortness of breath or chest pain.    |
| IV    | Symptoms of heart failure _at rest_. Any physical activity causes further discomfort.                                                                         |
